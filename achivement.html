<h1>Ratan Tata Success Story:A New Beginning at tata</h1>
<p>In 1961 after returning to India Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group. His first job involved working with the blue-collar employees at Tata Steel Ltd in Jamshedpur. “It was a total waste of time — I was shuffled around from department to department, but nobody actually told me what to do! I guess, I was looked at as a family member, so no one said anything to me — but I spent 6 months just trying to make myself look ‘useful’,” Tata said. He worked as an apprentice on the shop floor and his responsibilities included shoveling limestone and working with the furnaceces</p>
<p>After gaining experience he was promoted to management during the 1970s. He was made director and tasked with leading National Radio and Electronics (NELCO).
 He was able to turn the company around, but the company eventually collapsed during an economic slowdown. In 1977, he was tasked to turn around another troubled company, the Mumbai-based Empress Mills. He succeeded in doing so but the refusal to add investment into the company and the Mumbai textile workers’ strike led by Datta Samant eventually led to its closure in 1986.</p>
